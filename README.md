#Google Cardboard VR Toolkit Sample Project - Treasure Hunt

**NOTE**: This is pretty much the same as the project from Google except that 
* this is complied with Eclipse/ANT (instead of Android Studio)  and 
* refers to a library project for cardboard.jar instead of using a prebuilt binary.  

At present cardboard.jar is provided as binary along with treasure hunt cardboard sample at https://github.com/googlesamples/cardboard/

Google (+Christian Plagemann) replied on Google+ Cardboard & VR Developers Community promising the sources.
> Sources are coming. cardboard.jar just contains the binaries at this point. 

In the meantime, find the decompiled sources along with this project on github

The sample is well documented in https://developers.google.com/cardboard/get-started

If you refer to the library project for cardboard.jar, it has a minor change to let volume buttons cause the same effect as magnet pull on cardboard.

Usage:
* Import this project. 
* Add reference from Eclipse project properties (or android update from commandline) to the cardboard library project.
